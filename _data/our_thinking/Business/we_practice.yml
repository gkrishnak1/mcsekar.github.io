It is all about shorter, time boxed & automated approach to deliver a tangible piece of shippable work at the end of each iteration. Focus is not on writing perfect requirement document & a clean code but more about writing contextual code for tangible user stories that deliver business value. Agile & DevOps underpin the productivity of software development process. Agile focus on project management & delivery practices while DevOps improves the velocity of delivery & test cycles, enable faster feedback cycles, implement service virtualization, automation, refactoring practices and enable auto-orchestration of release pipeline. Leading the cultural shifts of the organization is the most important aspect before embarking the team for continuous improvement journey. These principles apply at large simply to improve software productivity with set objectives.'}
